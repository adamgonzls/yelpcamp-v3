      <p>
        YelpCamp was born in 2007 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their
        San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 4 million Hosts who have
        welcomed over 1.5 billion guest arrivals in almost every country across
        the globe. Every day, Hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make
        it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic
        way.
